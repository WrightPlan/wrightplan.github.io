          <h4>Security of Data</h4>
          <p>
            The security of your data is important to us, but remember that no

            its absolute security.
          </p>
          <p>
            All transmission of information to and from the App is encrypted in
            transit.
          </p>

          <h4>Data Retention</h4>
          <p>
            We will retain your personal data only for as long as necessary to
            fulfill the purposes outlined in this policy, unless a longer
            retention period is required or permitted by law. Mobile device

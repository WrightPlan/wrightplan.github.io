          <p>
            WrightPlan Inc. (“WrightPlan”, “we” or “us”) has developed the
            WrightPlan Field Solutions software application (the “App”) as part
            of its overall proprietary estimation software solution for
            businesses. The App is intended for use only by employees of
            businesses that have purchased the overall software solution from
            WrightPlan (the “Licensee”) and that are authenticated by the
            Licensee as having a license to use the App for field work performed
            for the Licensee (“you”). The App is for use by you, as a member of
            a field team (foremen, crane operations etc), to keep track of work
            hours, streamline time approvals, and stay organized with job
            assignments, job listings and detailed schedules.
          </p>
          <p>
            This policy is concerned with the protection of Personal Data and
            Usage Data. “Personal Data” includes any data that can be used to
            identify you as an individual, including your name, e-mail address
            identification numbers, user IDs, and location data. “Usage Data”
            means information on how the App is used by you, including your
            mobile device’s Internet Protocol address (e.g., IP address), mobile
            device type, mobile device version, the pages of our App that you
            visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those
            pages, unique device identifiers, device location, and other
            diagnostic data.
          </p>

          This policy describes the following practices:
          <ul>
            <li>Collecting information</li>
            <li>Using and Storing Personal Data and Usage Data</li>
            <li>Sharing Personal Data and Usage Data</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            NOTE: The App is intended only for licensed users as described in
            the first paragraph, none of whom should be under the age of 13. It
            is the Licensee’s responsibility to ensure that no licensed user is
            a child under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect, use or
            store any Personal Data or Usage Data regarding minors, and any
            uploads by you containing such information are solely your
            responsibility.
          </p>

        <section>
          <h3>Collecting Information</h3>
          We collect information about you through the App in the following
          ways:
          <dl>
            <dt>To log into and use the App</dt>
            <dd>
              We require you to enter your email address and first and last name
              in order to verify you as an authorized user of the App.
            </dd>

            <dt>Automatically by the App</dt>
            <dd>
              The App contains features that automatically collects Usage Data,
              such as user device information (operating system, phone model,
              and App version), usage statistics, and geolocation tracking
              information, which is linked to individual users.
            </dd>

            <dt>As part of your use of the App</dt>
            <dd>
              You have the ability to upload images or files to the App that may
              be viewed by the Licensee, or by third parties authorized by the
              Licensee. By uploading such images and files, you accept sole
              responsibility for the disclosure of any Personal Data contained
              in those images and files as described in the previous sentence,
              including obtaining all relevant consents from the affected
              individuals for such disclosure.
            </dd>

            <dt>As part of communications with WrightPlan</dt>
            <dd>
              If there are any issues with the App, such as crash reporting, you
              or the Licensee may submit a ticket, and as part of our response,
              we may collect more information from you in relation to the
              situation, which may include Personal Data and Usage Data.
            </dd>
          </dl>

          <h3>Using and Protecting Personal Data and Usage Data</h3>
          <p>
            WrightPlan uses reasonable precautions to protect Personal Data and
            Usage Data and to store it securely. Access to your Personal Data
            and Usage Data is restricted to those personnel who need it, and
            WrightPlan takes reasonable steps to prevent the unauthorized use or
            disclosure of Personal Data and Usage Data. All transmission of
            information to and from the App is encrypted in transit; however, no
            method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic
            storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially
            acceptable means to protect your Personal Data and Usage Data, we
            cannot guarantee its absolute security.
          </p>

          The Personal Data and Usage Data collected in relation to the App, as
          described above, is used for the following purposes:
          <ul>
            <li>To provide and maintain the App</li>
            <li>To notify you about changes to our App</li>
            <li>
              To allow you to participate in interactive features of our App
              when you choose to do so
            </li>
            <li>To provide customer support</li>
            <li>
              To gather analysis or valuable information so that we can improve
              our App
            </li>
            <li>To monitor the usage of the App</li>
            <li>To detect, prevent, and address technical issues</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Any geolocation or tracking information will be used solely for
            disclosure to the Licensee (your employer) to enable the Licensee to
            verify your location during your field work and to verify
            information that you submit through the App, such as time tracking
            and travel times.
            <strong
              >If you do not consent to this disclosure, it is solely your
              responsibility to cease using the App and to take up the issue of
              withholding your consent with the Licensee.</strong
            >
          </p>

          <p>
            We will retain your Personal Data only for as long as necessary to
            fulfill the purposes outlined in this policy, unless a longer
            retention period is required or permitted by law. The App retains
            mobile device location history for a default period of 90 days (note
            that the Licensee’s (your company’s) deployment of the App may have
            a shorter or longer retention period).
          </p>

          <p>
            Please be advised that your information, including Personal Data,
            may be transferred to &mdash; and maintained on &mdash; computers
            located outside of your state, province, country, or other
            governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ
            from those of your jurisdiction.
          </p>

          <p>
            WrightPlan may combine your Personal Data and Usage Data with other
            information into an aggregate form, so your information no longer
            personally identifies you. We may then use and/or disclose the
            aggregate information to third parties.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Sharing Personal Data and Usage Data</h3>
          <p>
            Subject to the below, WrightPlan provides your Personal Data and
            Usage Data to third parties only for purposes to which you have
            consented (including to the Licensee as described herein). We do not
            sell or rent your Personal Data to any third parties.
          </p>

          In a few situations, WrightPlan may be required to disclose your
          Personal Data and/or Usage Data without your prior consent. For
          example, WrightPlan may disclose your information if we are required
          to do so by law, as required by our contract with the Licensee
          authorizing you to use the App, or if we believe in good faith that
          such disclosure is necessary to:
          <ul>
            <li>comply with law or legal process</li>
            <li>
              protect and defend our rights and property, or the rights and
              property of a third party
            </li>
            <li>
              protect against misuse or unauthorized use of any of WrightPlan’s
              products, software, services, or other proprietary materials
            </li>
            <li>protect the personal safety of any person</li>
            <li>
              allow for a change of ownership of WrightPlan and associated
              transfer of all personal information to the new owner of
              WrightPlan – this does not affect the protection of your
              information under this Privacy Policy
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            WrightPlan will always try to provide you with prior notice of such
            disclosure; however, such notice may not always be possible or
            reasonable given the circumstances.
